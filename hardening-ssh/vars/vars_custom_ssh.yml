# -- IMPORTANT ------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The playbook disables all SSH access without public-key. A user with
# public key must and root privileges must exist on the system.
#
#       Otherwise, remote login with SSH is not longer possible!

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------

# TCP Port(s) to use with SSH. 
ssh_server_ports:
  - 22
  # -  you can define more if needed.

# Enable if IPv6 should be used:
ipv6_enable: false

# Enable (true) if a dedicated IPv4 management interface is used.
mgmt_interface_ipv4: false
# Define IPv4 address for mgmt interface if needed (default all).
ipv4_mgmt_interface: "0.0.0.0"
# Enable if (true) a dedicated IPv6 management interface is used.
mgmt_interface_ipv6: false
# Define IPv6 address for mgmt interface if needed (default all).

# Set the following parameters to generate a user with root privileges, public
# key authentication and permission to login via SSH.
new_ssh_user: false
# Set user name.
ssh_user_name: ""
# Set path to public-key file (e.g. id_rsa.pub).
# Place file in folder 'files' or configure own path to your private key.

# Change if other group is used for sudo.

# -- NOTE ----------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The following variables can be used to define your own hardening setup.
# Set a variable 'config-req-xx' to 'false' if you want to skip it during
# hardening if it is not applicable for your setup.
#
# You must document the reason why it is N/A from your point of view in
# Statement of Compliance (SoC) list for Privacy & Security Assessment!
